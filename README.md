# Bulls and Cows
<h2>What is that?</h2>
<p>This is a really <b>simple</b> game for two players.<br>
  One of them should try to guess the number that another player chose<br>
  You should read about this game <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows">here</a> (or <a href = "https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B">here</a> if you know russian)<br></p>
<br>
<h2>What tools did I used?</h2>
<p>In this current branch I used C languege (only for main function and some basic user interaction),<br>
mainly I used MASM for x86 (because I know how to make simple stuff more complex :)<br></p>
<br>
<h2>Why MASM ?</h2>
<p>Because I can. Actually, there is another version of this programm for NASM (I hope so)<br></p>
<br>
<h2>Why x86 and not x64 ?</h2>
<p>I don't know. Because I wanted so. <i>NASM version is x64</i><br></p>
<br>
<h2>Why did I used C, instend of interruptions. </h2>
<p>Actually, I couldn't. There are no DOS-like interruptions in Windows <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2354167/why-is-my-masm32-program-crashing-whenever-i-try-using-interrupts">(read this page)</a>.</p>
As always, good luck, have fun.
